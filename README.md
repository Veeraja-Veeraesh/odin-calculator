# Odin-Calculator

This document provides an overview, usage instructions, and technical details for the MashupJam Calculator, a simple web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Title and Description

**Odin Calculator** is a basic web application that allows users to perform mathematical calculations using a familiar calculator interface.

Design inspired by: [Captain Usopp](https://github.com/Captain-Usopp/Calculator)

## Key Features

* Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
* Handles percentages
* Includes clear and backspace buttons
* Displays current expression and calculated solution

## Technologies Used

* HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
* CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the calculator interface.
* JavaScript: Implements the logic and interactivity of the calculator.

## Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) with JavaScript enabled.

## Installation Guide

**The MashupJam Calculator does not require installation.** It is a web application that can be accessed directly through a web browser. You can open the `index.html` file in your browser to run the calculator.

## Usage Examples

**Basic Arithmetic:**

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the number buttons to enter your desired expression.
3. Click on the corresponding operator button (+, -, x, /) to perform the calculation.
4. The solution will be displayed in the bottom section of the display.

**Example:**

* Enter "2 + 3" using the number buttons.
* Click the "+" button.
* The solution "5" will be displayed.

**Percentage:**

1. Enter the base value (e.g., 100).
2. Click the "%" button.
3. Enter the percentage value (e.g., 10).
4. Click the desired operator button (e.g., "+" for adding the percentage).
5. The solution will reflect the percentage calculation.

**Clear and Backspace:**

* Use the "AC" (All Clear) button to clear both the expression and solution.
* Use the "âŒ«" (Backspace) button to delete the last entered character in the expression.

**Decimal:**

* Click on the "." button to enter a decimal point in the expression.

**Error Handling:**

* Division by zero will trigger an alert message.

## Configuration (if applicable)

This calculator does not require any specific configuration.

## Project Structure Explanation

The project consists of the following files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the overall structure of the calculator web page.
* `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles that define the visual appearance of the calculator interface (buttons, display, layout).
* `script.js`: Implements the core functionality of the calculator using JavaScript. It handles user interactions, updates the display, performs calculations, and manages internal states.

## Contributing Guidelines (if found in the codebase)

No specific contribution guidelines were found within the codebase.
